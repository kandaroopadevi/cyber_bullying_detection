#  Cyber Bullying Detection System

A Machine Learning–based system to detect cyberbullying content from user text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classification algorithms.

---

## Project Overview

Cyberbullying is a serious issue on social media platforms.  
This project analyzes user-provided text and classifies it as **Bullying** or **Non-Bullying** using Machine Learning techniques.

This project demonstrates:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning model training & prediction
- REST API development using Flask
- Clean project structure suitable for real-world applications

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python  
- Flask  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- TF-IDF Vectorizer  
- Logistic Regression

##  How the System Works

1. User enters text
2. Text is cleaned and preprocessed
3. TF-IDF converts text into numerical features
4. ML model predicts bullying or non-bullying
5. Result is returned through API
